# April 21

I opened my eyes slowly, nearly suffocating from the filthy smells all around me. I am surrounded  by a forest of feet and legs. I am thrown on the ground between these overcrowded feet, the disgusting smell of feet, the smell of blood, the smell of infected wounds, the smell of the ground which has not been cleaned for a long time...and the heavy breathing of all the men standing crammed together.

*Later, I did a headcount and found that there were 86 of us in there. Looking at the ceiling, I estimated that the room was no more than 25 square metres in size!*

The conversations between people were going by silently.
