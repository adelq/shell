# April 20

I stood on the staircase of the plane looking at the airport buildings. I look at the distant lights, the lights of my city. It was a wonderful moment.

I got down, took my bag and passport, feeling comforted, the feeling of one who returns to his home and familiar corners after a long absence.

The employee asked me to wait. He read my passport, returned to his papers, and then asked me to wait, so I waited. Two men from security took my passport and gently asked me to join them.

Me and my bag - the one that I never saw afterwards - and a trip in the security car on the long road from the airport. I watched the lights on the side of the road, and I watched the lights of my city get closer. I turned to the security worker closer to me and asked him, "What's wrong? Why these procedures?!"

He placed his index finger on his lips, did not say a word, asking me to be silent, so I stayed silent!

A trip from the airport to that depressing building in the center of the capital. A trip in space.

And since that moment I had thirteen more years ahead! A trip in time.

I found out later that one of them, while he was a student with us in Paris, has written a report that promoted him to the security body that pertained to it. The report stated that I had uttered words that opposed the current regime, and that I had uttered words that injured the reputation of the president of the country. This action was considered the most serious of crimes, the same as treason if not worse.

And this happened three years before my return from Paris.

That report guided me to this building in the center of the capital - close to our house. This building that I knew very well, for as long as I have passed in front of it. At the time, I was ignorant of what it contained, and the security measures around it.

The security workers took me with them, and their grip around my wrists got tighter after we passed the door to the long hallway. At the end of the hallway, there was a young man who yelled when he saw us, "Hey there Musa, what's this?! Green or red?"

"It's all shittier than each other"

From the hallway to the next, an inner stairway, an upper hallway, and a room to the right. He knocked on the door, and a voice came from inside said to enter.

My escort opened the door quietly, then stomped on the ground loudly and said, "My respect sir. This is the wanted man. We brought him from the airport, sir."

A distinct smell wafted to my noise, a smell which cannot be found anywhere but in security officer's offices. It's a mix of smells, different perfumes, rich cigarettes, the smell of human sweat, and the smell of feet.
