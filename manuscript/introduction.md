I sat with Susan in the airport cafeteria in Paris waiting for the departure of the airplane that will take me to my country after six years.

Until the last quarter hour, Susan persisted in persuading me to stay in France, and I heard the same excuses she has been telling me for the last month when I first let her know of my decision to return to the nation and work there. I am from an Arab Catholic family. Half the family lives in Paris, and so the door was wide open for me to study in this country. My education was easy and affordable, especially since I was improving my French before I came to Paris. I studied cinema studies and I was successful in my studies. And now I am returning after my graduation to my country and city.

Susan is also from an Arab family, but her entire family immigrated and lives in France. We became good friends in the last two years of my study, and we could have gotten married with the blessing of both of our families were it not for my insistence to return to the country, and her insistence to remain in France.

I told her decisively for the last debate while we are in the airport, "Susan, I love my country, my city. I love its streets and its corners. This is not an empty romance, it's an original feeling. I've memorized the phrases engraved on the old houses in my neighborhood, I adore them and miss them. That's first, second, I would like to be a distinguished director, and I have lots of plans, and my ambition is huge. In France I will remain foreign, working like any other refugee, discriminating against me in some cases...no, I don't want that. In my country, I have my rights, and nobody can discriminate against me. With little effort, I can establish my presence."

"Because of this, my decision for returning is final, and every attempt to convince me otherwise is futile"

Everything went silent for a few minutes. We heard the announcment. It was time to board the plane, we stood up, we drank what beer remained in our cups in one go. I looked at her emotionally, and I caught the development of tears in her eyes. She threw herself on my chest, and I embraced her quickly. *I can't stand this situation.*

I said, "I wish you a happy life." She replied, "I wish you the same, and I urge you to be cautious, keep yourself safe."

And I boarded the plane.
